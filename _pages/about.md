I am working on the problem of missing values in supervised learning with [Marine Le Morvan](https://marinelm.github.io/) and [Gaël Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info/). I work on the [NeuMiss neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01627) and its adaptation to classification settings to derive a learner with a differentiable optimization procedure to perform classification with missing values.

I have a mathematical and computational background acquired at [École des Ponts](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr/en) and at the [MVA Master's program](https://www.master-mva.com/) of [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en).
